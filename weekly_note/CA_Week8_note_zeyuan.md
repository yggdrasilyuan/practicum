## meeting note
talk about last week's plan:
combine the two different time period data together.
Check the distribution, outlier for the data, and construct the at least hypothesis.
We also need to check the Mar 2011 health care sector for the outlier.

we did all of them in this week.

For new historical data and the origin data, we should combine them together, as they represent different annual reports.
Meanwhile we should construct a frame work to backtest our hypothesis.

we should fix the backtesting model ,like what we do on our portfolio test is so simple and navie. We should fix them.
