## meeting note
Zishan and koby gave me lots of suggestions about how to fix our backtesting system.
We could change the algorithm how to organize the 6 months before. 
we should change portfolio monthly but to go over the before months' data.

we also should keep digging on the hypothesis that we propose in this week and do more things about global portfolios.
