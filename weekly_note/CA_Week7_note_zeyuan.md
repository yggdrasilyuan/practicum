# Zeyuan Pan's Week7 note
## Contribute
- extracting information and combined them into onefile from the new dataset that uploaded on the ftp
- check the outlier for the whole data 
- work as a group leader and make some silds

## meeting note
talk about last week's plan:
rerun the new data which is from the ftp dataset.
check the outlier in the dataset.
Map the stock price into the global form, combine the month data into one closed price.
Construct hypothesis to make some portfolios.

we did three of them in this week.

For new historical data and the origin data, we should combine them together, as they represent different annual reports.
Meanwhile we should construct a frame work to backtest our hypothesis.

we should specify the outlier to extract the documentID  and check if there is only one abnormal file or a group of them.
